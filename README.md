# IoT-Parking-Place
This project is designed to help manage parking spots in a specific location. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the control side of the project. For the executive side, we've used the Arduino IDE to program both the NodeMCU ESP8266 and the Arduino Mega 2560.

The control side communicates with the executive side through Firebase, allowing for easy data transfer and management. We've used a photoresistor as a sensor to detect when a car is present in a parking spot and a servo motor to act as a ramp. Additionally, we've used diodes to mark reserved parking spots.
